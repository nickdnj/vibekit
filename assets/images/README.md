# VibeKit Logo

## Adding the Logo

To add the VibeKit logo to display in the main README:

1. Save your logo image as `vibekit-logo.png` in this directory
2. The README.md is already configured to display it automatically
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
4. Recommended size: 300px width or larger for crisp display

## Logo Guidelines

- Use high-resolution images (at least 600px width)
- PNG format is preferred for logos with transparency
- SVG format works well for vector graphics
- Keep file size under 1MB for fast loading

## Current Setup

The main README references: `assets/images/vibekit-logo.png`

Simply replace this file with your actual logo and it will appear automatically!
